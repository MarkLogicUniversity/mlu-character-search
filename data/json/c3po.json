    "bio": "Created with discarded scrap metal and parts by a young Anakin Skywalker on Tatooine, C-3PO was originally made to help Anakin's mother Shmi with household chores. Threepio would later meet his lifelong droid friend R2-D2 when Anakin befriended Padmé Amidala. Threepio and Artoo would pair up again for many adventures, although the protocol droid dreaded danger and would much rather focus on etiquette and diplomacy. Threepio would later serve useful as a translator for not only Padmé in negotiations during the Clone Wars, but also much later for other human companions Princess Leia and Luke Skywalker. The protocol droid's talent for communicating in other languages comes in handy when delegating with Jabba the Hutt, the Talz, and Ewoks.",
