He served as a General in the Repulic's army, with Clone Commander Cody often at his side. For over a decade Obi-Wan guided young Anakin Skywalker on the path to Jedi Knighthood. Having to rein in an adventure-seeking youth made Obi-Wan wise -- and cynical -- beyond his years. True to his role, Obi-Wan recognized both Anakin's strengths and weaknesses, and he tried to impart his lessons with the patience and understanding that his mentor, Qui-Gon, did. Following the tragedy of the Clone Wars, and the rise of the Galactic Empire, Obi-Wan was one of the few Jedi survivors. He hid on Tatooine, living in exile while keeping a watchful eye over Luke Skywalker, Anakin's son who was also strong in the Force.",
