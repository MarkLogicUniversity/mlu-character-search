After his stepparents were murdered by the Empire, he destroyed the Death Star and became the Rebellion's greatest hero. But Luke's true destiny lay with the Jedi Order. He learned the ways of the Force from Obi-Wan Kenobi and Yoda, and discovered the terrible secret of his parentage. Luke insisted there was still good in Darth Vader, and his love for his father reawakened Anakin's spirit, inspiring him to sacrifice himself to destroy Darth Sidious.",
