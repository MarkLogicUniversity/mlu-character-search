Han and his co-pilot Chewbacca flew the freighter Millennium Falcon to help the Rebels destroy the Death Star, but when Jabba the Hutt placed a price on his head, he was frozen in a carbonite slab and hung in Jabba's palace. His friends, including Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, and Lando Calrissian, rescued Han in time for him to lead the ground attack that led to a Rebel triumph in the Battle of Endor.",
