A skilled starship mechanic and fighter pilot's assistant, he formed an unlikely but enduring friendship with the fussy protocol droid C-3PO.  R2-D2's mechanical body contains numerous arms tipped with all manner of useful tools, from welding torches to computer interfaces. Like other astromechs, his language is a cacophony of beeps and whistles understandable only by some other droids. But the spunky little droid's abundant personality generally makes his meaning plain enough.",
